## CUBE

The purpose of this task was to create  a function mx_cube that prints a representation of a 3d cube to the standard ouput.

The size of the cube depends on the variable n  which is passed to the function as a parameter.

There are some tips that help you to draw cube as it must be:

• you can use only +, -, /, |  and space characters to draw a cube

• number of | in one vertical line equals to n

• number of -  in one horizontal line equals to 2 * n

• number of /  in one diagonal line equals to n / 2

A cube can be produced only if n > 1. Otherwise, the program does not print anything.


**Console output**

• for n = 12

## PYRAMID

The purpose of this task was to create a function mx_pyramid that prints a representation of a 3d pyramid to the standard output.

The size of the pyramid depends on the variable n  which is passed to the function as a parameter.

There are some tips which help you to draw a pyramid as in the CONSOLE OUTPUT section:

• you can use only /, \, |, _ (underscore) and space to draw a pyramid

• the number of /  in line that relates to the front triangle, equals to n

• the number of \  in line that relates to the front and side triangles, equals to n - 1 

• the number of \  in line that relates only to the side triangle, equals to n / 2

• the number of |  in vertical line equals to n / 2

• the number of _  in horizontal line equals to 2 * n - 3

A pyramid can be produced only if its size is even and n > 1. Otherwise, the programdoes not print anything

**Console output**

• for n = 20
